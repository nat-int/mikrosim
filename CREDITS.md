particles are simulated using a technique described [in this presentation](https://ramakarl.com/pdfs/2014_Hoetzlein_FastFixedRadius_Neighbors.pdf) with [prefix sum algorithm from chapter 39 of nvidia gpugems 3 (without the bank conflict fix)](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda)
fluid simulation is done as [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE)
